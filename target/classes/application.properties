<bean name="speakerService" class="com.example.service.SpeakerServiceImpl">
        <property name="speakerRepository" ref="speakerRepositoryBean"/>
</bean>
//the name is reference to the setter method name. if the setter was setSpeakerRepository, then the name in the property
// would be speakerRepository

//Also we use ref because we reference another bean's name. we can use value if we are gonna send a hard coded value
